        <p>Hi, my name is Andrii Sichkarenko, and I am from Crimea, Ukraine. I am passionate about taking things from nature and use it in our lives. That's why I am an avid mushroom hunter.
        <br>I have been working in SEO for a few years, helping companies rank on the first page of Google.
        <br>Now, I am working at a non-profit that is focused on helping Ukrainians outlast their invaders.
